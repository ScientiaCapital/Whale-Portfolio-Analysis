# Emergency Fund and Retirement Planning Analysis

According to _themedium.com_, "A whale is any individual or company who has enough money and power to directly influence the price of a cryptocurrency or stock, usually in a negative way. Think of a whale and their large mass. They can make huge splashes and the same concept can be applied to crypto/financial markets."

## Technologies


Before attempting to execute any _Python_ code in `risk_return_analysis.ipynb`, it is imperative that your development environment holds the following modules:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Data analysis module.

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Data visualization module.

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine. 

2. Open _Jupyter Lab_ or _Jupyter Notebook_ via _Anaconda Navigator_ and navigate to the directory in which the file `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` is present. _All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line_. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and _Python_ modules are installed (see __Technologies__ and __Installation Guide__ for more details) before attempting to execute code within _Jupyter Notebook_; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors! 

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "__Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return__" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. _It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors_!.
